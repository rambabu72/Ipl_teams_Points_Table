# Ipl_teams_Points_Table
### This is a project shows points of ipl teams with 5 recent match status with having 2 classes in it. 
### I've created a arraylist data structure to add the objects.
# Created a 3 cases to implement the conditions:
### In that first case we can read the team data of the last 5 matchs status.
### Second case we can find the consecutive wins or consecutive losses data of teams.
### Third case we can calculate the average points of teams which wins or losses matches consecutively.
